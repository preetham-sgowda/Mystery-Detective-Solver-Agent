## 🧪 Sample Mystery to Try

**Case Description:**
Lord Blackwood was found dead in his locked study at Blackwood Manor. 
The time of death is estimated between 9 PM and 11 PM. 
A half-empty glass of whiskey sat on his desk. No signs of forced entry.

**Clues:**
- A monogrammed handkerchief with the initials "V.B." was found under the desk
- The poison used was cyanide, tasteless and odorless when dissolved in alcohol
- The manor's back door was unlocked despite the butler claiming to have locked it at 8 PM
- A recent will discovered shows Lord Blackwood changed his beneficiary last week
- The kitchen staff reported hearing an argument between Lord Blackwood and his niece Victoria at 8:30 PM
- Footprints in the garden match a woman's shoe size 6

**Suspects:**
- Victoria Blackwood (niece, recently cut from the will)
- James the butler (employed for 20 years, recently passed over for a raise)
- Dr. Helena Marsh (family physician, secret affair with the lord)
- Thomas Blackwood (estranged son, returned from abroad last week)
